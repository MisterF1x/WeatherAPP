Welcome to my project! This web
[weather app](https://misterf1x.github.io/WeatherAPP/) is a web-based
application built using JavaScript and an open source API
[open-meteo.com](https://open-meteo.com). It allows users to check the weather
in their area, as well as in other locations around the world. The app retrieves
up-to-date weather information from the API, and displays it in an easy-to-read
format on the user's device.

The app likely has several key features, including:

- Current weather information: This includes the current temperature, humidity,
wind speed, and other relevant details.

- Forecast information: The app likely provides a forecast for the coming days,
including high and low temperatures, precipitation chances, and other details.

- Location selection: Users can select their current location or input a
different location to view weather information for that area.

- Customization options: Users may be able to customize the app to suit their
preferences, such as choosing units of measurement.

Overall, web weather app provides users with a convenient and reliable way to
stay informed about current and upcoming weather conditions.
